In this project we are predicting the houses prices, depicted by the median_house_value column.
The median_house_value column is a continuous variable, so we are talking about a regression problem. We are going to follow the following steps:

1. Initial EDA to have a glimpse of the data distribution and the data itself
2. We will deal with the missing data
3. Model test and evaluation
4. Model Selection and improvement
5. Conclusion
